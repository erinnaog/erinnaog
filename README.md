- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @erinnaog
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Data-driven decision making
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Analysis and other relevants entrepreneurship skills
- Confession: Getting started in Data Analysis is one of the best decision I have ever made, 
it allows me to explore more possiblities I have never thought could happened without data, 
it is also wonderful to see how nunches of data with different formats, different types, 
different categories come together and enable the potential analysis that solve the world-problem.
My initial dream was to become an impactful young entrepreneur, and getting into data is a great 
stepping stone for me to build more sustainable, impactful and resillient solution.
